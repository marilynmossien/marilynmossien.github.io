			<h1 id="mission"> <center> OUR MISSION: In the 2012 presidential election, only 19% of 18-29 year olds voted. Our goal is to increase the voter turnout, specifically among young adults. 
To do this, we have brainstormed ways to educate people on important issues in an engaging way. We hope to involve people in current issues and 
empower them with the basic knowledge to pursue an interest in politics. </center> </h1>
