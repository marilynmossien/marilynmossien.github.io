		<p><div class='name'>The Ocelot<img src="https://revolutionaryecology.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/ocelot09b.jpg" width="140" height="140"></div></p>
		<p><div class='description'>The ocelot, also known as the dwarf leopard, is a wild cat whose fur is similar to that of a clouded leopard or jaguar. Its beautiful fur was once much sought after, and hundreds of thousands were poached for their fur. However, there have been restrictions on the trade, and social norms have veered away from animal fur, the ocelot has not been classified as a vulnerable species since 1996.</div></p>
	
		<p><div class='name'>The Red Wolf<img src="http://i.imgur.com/iWEgb.jpg" width="140" height="140"></div></p>
		<p><div class='description'>This beautiful animal, its fur usually a red or tawny color, is similar to coyotes and grey wolves. There is a controversy over whether the red wolf is originally a hybrid of the coyote and the grey wolf, or its own independent species. The red wolf came close to extinction in the mid 1900s, largely due to predator control programs. In 1980, it was declared extinct in the wild, and since then there has been restoration efforts. A population was bred in captivity; in 1987 the captive animals were released into the wild.</div></p>   

		<p><div class='name'>The Polar Bear<img src="http://www.nathab.com/uploaded-files/carousels/TRIPS/Tundra-Lodge/Polar-Bears-Tundra-Lodge-7-bear-cubs.jpg" width="140" height="140"></div></p>
		<p><div class='description'>Fun fact: polar bears are strong swimmers, and their front paws are slightly webbed. Though they have white fur, their skin is black, because darker colors absorbs heat from the sun well. Female polar bears, who usually give birth to twins, are aggressive in protecting their young, and stay with their infants from about 28 months. These strong animals have no natural predator. However, they are in danger of going extinct due to global warming, which is causing a major loss of habitat for the polar bears. </div></p>
		
		<p><div class='name'>The Jaguar<img src="http://animalia-life.com/data_images/jaguar/jaguar1.jpg" width="140" height="140"></div></p>
		<p><div class='description'>The jaguar, a popular, beautiful feline is the largest cat in North and South America. The main reason for the population decline of this animal is the large amount of hunting for it's fur in the 1960s and 70s. Fortunately, the jaguar is now more protected, and jaguar hunting is illegal in many countries. However, some poaching still occurs. Furthermore, due to deforestation, it has suffered from loss and fragmentation of it's habitat. Here's a fun fact: the Jaguar is present in many Indigenous American cultures, like Mayan and Aztec mythology.</div></p>
		
		<p><div class='name'>California Floristic Province<img src="http://www.fragmentedforests.org/wp-content/gallery/california-floristic-province-forests_1/california_floristic_province_04.jpg" width="140" height="140"></div></p>
		<p><div class='description'>So, what exactly if a floristic province? It references a geographic area with a similar composition of plant species. The California Floristic Province is also a biodiversity hotspot, which means it contains plants and animals that exist nowhere else in the world. It's habitants are hurting, due to urban expansion, and agriculture; it is known as one of the most ecologically degraded expanses in the USA. Furthermore, because it is a biodiversity hotspot, efforts for conservation have little funding, because neither plant nor animal that are distinct in this region can be found in another expanse, and thus cannot be replicated.</div></p>
	
		<p><div class='name'>Jaguarundi<img src="http://media.nbcdfw.com/images/1200*675/jaguarundi.jpg" width="140" height="140"></div></p>
		<p><div class='description'>The jaguarundi, otherwise known as the eyra cat, small in size, strange in name, seemingly more weasel than cat, and bearing no spots on it's coat, is a generally unheard of feline. These cats have mostly solitary lifestyles. They have an unusual range of vocally produced sounds, ranging from whistles, chattering sounds, and bird like whistles; they possess 13 different sounds. It is estimated that it's population has declined by 90 percent in certain ranges.</div></p>
